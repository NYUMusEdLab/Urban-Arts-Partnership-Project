"Geo-o-o-graphy

Affects how people adapt

Geo-o-o-graphy

When land is all we have

Geo-o-o-graphy

But the population expands

Geo-o-o-graphy

When the land is all we have

Verse 1

The way the land is shaped is topography

Mountains isolate, a harbor’s by the sea

Geography affects the whole economy

Along with the climate, products of our environment

I admit, I don’t forget, well, rarely

The first civilization started in river valleys

Tigris and Euphrates, specifically

In Mesopatamia, today that is the Middle East

And it be a segment of the Fertile Crescent,

Additionally, the Crescent includes the Nile River where Egyptians 

be

China has the Yellow River, the Huang He

Rivers serve as highways no concrete

They keep the land fertile, farming is the business

In India and Pakistan that river is the Indus

Now, let’s take a minute for the geographic regions 

Some have the same climate year-round, some have some seasons

A desert’s dry and arid, erosion in badlands

Prairies good for grazing, savannahs are open grasslands

Today the slash and burn farming

Destroys the rainforests in the humid tropics – it’s alarming!

Chorus

Verse 2

Travel around the globe and then I come back

To geographic landmarks on a physical map

Then I look on the atlas of the world and discover

Irregular coastlines make natural harbors

It’s safe from the power of the ocean’s force

It’s good for a boat if it’s a warm water port

Did you notice that Florida is just like Italy?

Surrounded by water on three sides, and this means

They are peninsulas, and did I mention the

Islands confined by water on every singular side?

The archipelago is a chain of islands like Japan

All that water probably means it’s good for fishing, or shipping

A narrow land strip across the water’s called an isthmus

This is connecting two larger landmasses

Panama shares this feature with Costa Rica

And mountains makes it tough to build a garden

Japanese and Incas had to use terrace farming

To get water where it’s scarce, we used irrigation

Technology makes living possible in different places

Chorus","Intro

Well, history is always told in the eyes of the conqueror, isnít it?

If it wasn’t, it wouldn’t be his-story; it would be our-story

And what is more fearful than the savagery of our story?

Chorus

What makes a savage civilized?

Is it when our government is centralized?

Our social class and labor is specialized

Communication, religion is organized

Verse 1

Now this a story all about how

The way people live turned upside down

I’d like take a minute, just sit with me

I’ll tell you how it went down in 4000 BC

Before the world was all hunters and gatherers

Then they started farming, raising domestic animals

And this led to a surplus of food

They start to settle down and not really move

Cities began to rise, jobs were specialized

Technology developed - you call them civilized

Y’all call this time the Neolithic Revolution

From hunters and gatherers, to farmers not moving

Traditional societies, the first in the beginning

Passing on traditions from parents to children

Farming only enough for the fam’: subsistence

Didn’t use money they traded in barter systems

Chorus

What makes a savage civilized?

Is it when our government is centralized?

Our social class and labor is specialized

Communication, religion is organized

Verse 2

Water is life, life water delivers

So people settled in fertile valleys near rivers

Egypt had the Nile where they worshipped Osiris

Mesopotamia had the Euphrates and Tigris

Droughts and dry crops led to starvation

We left Central Africa: the Bantu Migration

Villages grew to cities, population grew higher

Spread and control the land, making an empire

First was Babylon, they got their battle on to grow

Babylonians were ruled by Hammurabi’s Code

You know, ‘An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth’

Same code of the streets ‘round me and you

Empires come and empires going

Babylon, Greece; after Greeks, then the Romans

Greeks contributed in math and astronomy

Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle, they wrote philosophy

Chorus

What makes a savage civilized?

Is it when our government is centralized?

Our social class and labor is specialized

Communication, religion is organized

Verse 3

In the Greek city-states, the rule of people was the policy

They say the Greeks were the world’s first democracy

And Athens was its birthplace

And yes, Sparta was a military state

And Greece expanded to Persia with a man a commander named 

Alexander the Great

Hellenistic culture influenced all

Rome rose after the Greeks would fall

Romans built roads, thickened their walls

Governed by Twelve Tables: their first written laws

Pax Romana was peacetime for Rome

Emperor Justinian made Justinian Code

A legal code nations would later model

It said Christ was the God Rome would follow

Rome fell when nothing else seemed hopeful

Byzantine rose from Constantinople

Located between Europe and Asia

Goods and ideas were exchanged by traders

Ancient civilizations saw changes

Laws laid the foundation for the Middle Ages

Chorus

What makes a savage civilized?

Is it when our government is centralized?

Our social class and labor is specialized

Communication, religion is organized","Verse 1

Religion is more than praying, so what you saying though?

Systems of beliefs that guide the life that shape it, yo

Scriptures still exist interpreted from ancient scrolls

And so we debate and end up in the danger zone

Though we all have a sense of higher purpose

Pay homage to a power through sacrifice and worship

The major difference between the west and east:

How many gods? How many deities?

The monotheistic believe in one god:

Judaism, Christianity, and Islam

The polytheistic believe in more than one

In China and India, let’s look at some:

Confucianism, Hinduism, Buddhism

I guess, I guess we got our, got our own truisms

Who’s to, who’s to say who’s the true religion?

They say our generation doesn’t fool with them

Chorus

My goodness

And they say, ìWhat you believe in?î

My goodness

Oh my god, my goodness

And they say, ìWhat you believe in?î

My goodness, oh my god

They say our generation is the least religious

Preaching in our face, we don’t even listen!

My goodness

And they say, ìWhat you believe in?î

My goodness, oh my god

Verse 2

Monotheistic systems of belief

Religions originating in Middle East

Fighting over holy land, fighting for survival

In the so-called holy wars, they’re the rivals

Christianity, Jesus, the disciples

Under one God, and the sacred book: the Holy Bible

The Ten Commandments in it, and the New Testament

Missionaries spread the word: they’re evangelists

Judaism has one god

In the words of the Sh’ma, ìAdonai echadî

The holy book: the Old Testament, the Torah, the Talmud

In Islam, there’s a warrior named Mohammed, that’s the prophet

Holy book: Qu’ran

The Five Pillars of Islam guides the lives of man

2 pillars I know, 2 pillars I remember

Pray five times a day and pilgrimage to Mecca

Chorus

My goodness

And they say, ìWhat you believe in?î

My goodness

Oh my god, my goodness

And they say, ìWhat you believe in?î

My goodness, oh my god

They say our generation is the least religious

Preaching in our face, we don’t even listen!

My goodness

And they say, ìWhat you believe in?î

My goodness, oh my god

Verse 3

The polytheistic systems of belief

Philosophies, religions of the far east

Buddhism’s guided by the Four Noble Truths

They seek enlightenment, that’s what I hope for you!

Practice good karma, meditate, relax

You can reach nirvana, follow [the] Eightfold Path

Hinduism: karma, dharma, caste system

A social pyramid divided by class difference

Live your life full of good will and patience

You’ll die and be reborn in a better situation

That’s reincarnation, maintain the inner vision

The five relationships relating to Confucianism

Ruler to ruled, spouse, friends, and family

Respect elders and ancestors: filial piety

Over in Japan, Shintoism’s their tradition

Everything in nature has a soul: animism

Everybody hold hands and get together and sing Kum-ba-ya, please

I would surely like it if everybody sang Kum-ba-ya together

Now, let us commence in about 2 bars

8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1...","Intro

We’re taking a journey

To where we’ll go, ain’t nobody know

Chorus

Taking that journey on the long Silk Road

I’m taking that journey on the long Silk Road

I’m trading some fur for some pretty silk clothes

I’m Marco Polo

Y’all already know

Taking that journey on the long Silk Road

I’m taking that journey on the long Silk Road

I’m trading some fur for some pretty silk clothes

I’m Marco Polo

Y’all already know

Verse 1

Far to the east, near China sea 

Empire grew: Ming Dynasty

Army of a million, a navy of fleets

Trade was led by the admiral by the name Zheng He

Yup, some served the government, the royal famí

But first they had to pass the civil service exams

They’re far from Europe though, you can’t take a rowboat 

Trade between China and Europe opened up by Marco Polo 

Spices and rices moved in a lot of grams

Connected through this Empire we call the Ottoman

Through the Middle East, products were steady moving

This trade increase was called commercial revolution

In South America, conquistadors were colonizing

And in Peru, the Incan Empire was steady fighting

The war between the natives and Portuguese invaders

And Spanish sailors brought disease and then they became the 

slavers

Chorus

Taking that journey on the long Silk Road

I’m taking that journey on the long Silk Road

I’m trading some fur for some pretty silk clothes Iím Marco Polo

Y’all already know

Taking that journey on the long Silk Road

I’m taking that journey on the long Silk Road

I’m trading some fur for some pretty silk clothes

I’m Marco Polo

Y’all already know

Verse 2

In the meanwhile, Mongolia got it on

Mongol Empire was ruled by Genghis Khan

The amount of land that he conquered was major

He helped increase trade between Europe and Asia

Speaking of Asia, the chain of island lands

Once ruled by the feudal system, you know it as Japan

The Tokugawa Shogunate, the shoguns ruled the area

And Japan practiced isolation in this Edo Period

The shogun was the emperor, the daimyo were the lords

The samurais with swords defend the land where peasants farm

In India, this ruler helped spread Buddhism all over

Ruled in the Maurya Dynasty: Emperor Ashoka

India’s Golden Age, creativity inspired

Came during the great reign of the great Gupta Empire

But in the 500s, the dynasty was done

Around this time India was invaded by the Huns

Chorus

Taking that journey on the long Silk Road

I’m taking that journey on the long Silk Road

I’m trading some fur for some pretty silk clothes

I’m Marco Polo

Y’all already know

Taking that journey on the long Silk Road (From Europe to Asia....and 

back)

I’m taking that journey on the long Silk Road

I’m trading some fur for some pretty silk clothes

I’m Marco Polo

Y’all already know

Verse 3

Before a ship came back with salt or spice for the payout

They had to cross the African kingdoms along the trade routes

The empires of Songhai, and Mali, and Ghana

Water in the Sahara or else you’re surely a goner

Timbuktu a very popular city with trade and treasure

Mansa Musa spread Islam on his pilgrimage to Mecca

Yeah, he was a connector

Europeans made sweaters with the silk they traded, feudal system - 

they made it

So land equals power, the church was the source

In the Crusades, Christianity was spread by force

It’s Europe vs. the Middle East, the Middle Ages: bad days

Soldiers and merchants started spreading around the black plague

One third of Europe dies, people had it harder

Took power from the king when they signed the Magna Carta

A lot of merchants trading goods, ideas, and religions

Culture diffusion and blooming capitalism","Part I: Exploration

Chorus

What if they explored and never found my shackles?

What if they were lost at sea?

What’s with all the talk of guns, gold, and tobacco?

Columbus Day is hard for me

I wish you a Renaissance

I wish you a Renaissance

I wish you a Renaissance

Columbus Day is hard for me

Verse 1

Right around 1492

When you know who sailed the ocean blue

Navigation technology improved

The Age of Exploration was new

The kings sent men to explore the globe

Led by Spain and Portugal

Columbian Exchange was horrible

Indians were enslaved to farm with hoes

Trade between ‘New World’ and Europe:

Horses and corn, not corn syrup

These ship captains praised and honored

Columbus, Dias, Vasco de Gama

Colonized their territory

Plant their flag for their country’s glory

To say they discovered America’s

Definitely a one-sided story

What about the Incas, Aztecs, and Mayans?

Were they really civilizations that needed the civilizing?

Or did Europeans not comprehend all their culture and science?  

Encomienda was the slave trade of natives who were steady dying, 

dying

Iberian Peninsula, yup

Where the Moors conquer the Spanish and Portuguese, yup

But Christian warriors finished this Muslim seizure

We call this The Reconquest or the Reconquista

Yup

Chorus

What if they explored and never found my shackles?

What if they were lost at sea?

What’s with all the talk of guns, gold, and tobacco?

Columbus Day is hard for me

I wish you a Renaissance

I wish you a Renaissance

I wish you a Renaissance

Columbus Day is hard for me

Verse 2

Explorers pave the way

For the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade

Indians and Africans

Were captured and sold to slavery

Triangular trade of people and goods

Between the west coast of Africa, America, Europe - so what?

A favorable trade balance is mercantilism

Where the mother country benefits from

Swindling colonies in a system

Where they find materials that are raw, but the mother country sell 

them imports

Meanwhile in Europe the Protestant Church is changing the laws, 

good God

The Catholic Church saw a new generation

Led by Martin Luther and the Protestant Reformation

The Church said you could buy your way to being sin-free

People bought indulgences to gain heavenly entry

Martin Luther challenged the greed of the indulgent priests

And nailed his 95 Theses to the door of the church on the street

And the church made mad dividends

Then the church tried to reform within

Prosecute those performing sins

Then Europe was reborn again in the Renaissance

Chorus

What if they explored and never found my shackles?

What if they were lost at sea?

What’s with all the talk of guns, gold, and tobacco?

Columbus Day is hard for me

I wish you a Renaissance

I wish you a Renaissance

I wish you a Renaissance

Columbus Day is hard for me

Part II - The Renaissance  

Excuse my French

But if you want to speak French then go en France

They’ll tell you rebirth means Renaissance

Renaissance

It’s the Renaissance

If you want to speak French then go en France

They’ll tell you rebirth means Renaissance

Yeah

Verse 3

If you want to speak French, then go en France

They’ll tell you ‘rebirth’ means Renaissance

New life for arts, literature, and science

Influenced by Protestants’ church defiance

European life inspired a new vision

Individuals before religion: humanism

Ideas were spreading real fast and fresh

Especially with the invention of the printing press

Machiavelli, DaVinci, Michaelangelo

William Shakespeare, and of course Donatello

They were all artists and writers in the movement

At the time of the Scientific Revolution

Knowledge of earth and planets was new, son

Galileo, Copernicus, and Isaac Newton

They changed science and mapped star charts

But often opposed the ideas of monarchs

Absolutism gave the ruler complete control

They used divine right so they could justify their role

Phillip II in Spain, Louis XIV in France

Elizabeth I brought the peace upon England

Kings and queens from God, they believed it their fate

Even in Russia they were ruled by Peter the Great

Glorious Revolution checked the king’s power, B

Establishing constitutional monarchy

Cause folks tired of being controlled all day and night

England rebelled and wrote their own Bill of Rights

Cause folks tired of being controlled all day and night

England rebelled and wrote their own Bill of Rights","Intro

Global History shouldn’t be a total mystery

Chorus 

This is the Age of Enlightenment

It’s after the Age of Reason

And it lasted 400 seasons

Democratize, nationalize

And give you something to believe in 

This is the Age of Enlightenment

It’s after the Age of Reason

And it lasted 400 seasons

Democratize, nationalize

And give you something to believe in 

Verse 1

I don’t believe in kings and queens

Cause I’m not an abrevity

I believe in you and me

I am not a celebrity - stop!

Word, I be reading Locke and Hobbes

And Voltaire, yo, he rocked the spot

From the gate

These individual rights that we have today

Date back to Catherine the Great

Baron de Montesquieu

People like Jean Jacques Rousseau

Wrote tomes that speak to your soul

When the people revolt

Find a reason that they need to fight

Rising up against the government

Looking for equal rights

Looking for a little taste of the freedom

They called it Enlightenment

They felt like they could see the light

You need the right leaders

You need the right soldiers

You need to write stories, write songs, write poems

They killed the class differences in your area

From France to the Americas 

Chorus 

This is the Age of Enlightenment

It’s after the Age of Reason

And it lasted 400 seasons

Democratize, nationalize

And give you something to believe in 

This is the Age of Enlightenment

It’s after the Age of Reason

And it lasted 400 seasons

Democratize, nationalize

And give you something to believe in 

Verse 2

In France, man, the word was great

Philosophy reverberate

The lower class got represented by the Third Estate

Fight for food, fight for shelter

Fight for space, fight for land

Fight until they wrote the Declaration of the Rights of Man

But that was only a start

We saw the rise of Napoleon Bonaparte

Yo, it’s lonely at the top

Take a country, then he’d take another

He was something of a nation crusher

Ran up on Spain and invaded Russia

The soldiers suffered

He had to surrender, had an agenda

But Europe was rebuilt by the Congress of Vienna

And then the monarchs re-ascended

The Enlightenment has colonies wanting they independence

There was Pancho Villa, Líouverture, and Simon Bolivar 

Latin America was going hard

They forever changed the map on this side

This is the beginning of national pride

Let’s ride!

Chorus 

This is the Age of Enlightenment

It’s after the Age of Reason

And it lasted 400 seasons

Democratize, nationalize

And give you something to believe in 

This is the Age of Enlightenment

Itís after the Age of Reason

And it lasted 400 seasons

Democratize, nationalize

And give you something to believe in","Intro

I know what you want

Money, power

Money, power

I know what you want

But is that what you need?

Verse 1

Moved from farms to factories

Lines for the assembly

Happened first in England, manufacturing and bagging tea

Building railroad to the mines

Digging for that coal and iron

Mass production, mass consumption, inventing the wholesale buyer

Companies start moving product, they start pushing big digits

The Industrial Revolution creating that big business

Governments tried regulating; businessmen said, ‘That ain’t fair!’

Adam Smith said, ‘Mind your business’, policy of laissez-faire

Industries grew, so did the cities

Urbanization isn’t all pretty

No labors laws, poor working conditions

If child workers were paid at all, wages below the minimum

Oh, it’s hard living to justify this system

And poverty’s existence, dark side of capitalism

Some believe in the principle Social Darwinism

Survival of the fittest, it’s what it is

Or is it?

Chorus

I know what you want

Colonies overseas

More money you come across

More power you seize 

Verse 2

The fight for workers’ rights really started to spark

In the Communist Manifesto written by Karl Marx

And all around the globe, this text was quoted, boss

Russia and China and Cuba, they all revolted, boss

People were overworked but business was still slammin’

Except the Irish starving because of Potato Famine

The potatoes were sick

A million Irish dead

It forced many to emigrate over to the U.S.

Communism vs. capitalism

Excessive pride in one’s nation’s is called nationalism

In Europe it rose as Italy’s in scattered divisions in several sides

But Garibaldi and Count Camilo Cavour unified

And in Germany, likewise, they’re split into different parts

Germany was brought together by Otto von Bismarck

There are strength in numbers, boss, and it’s like a numbers war

And I know you want

It’s that money, power, huh?

It’s that money, power, huh?

Chorus

I know what you want

Colonies overseas

More money you come across

More power you seize 

Verse 3

When a stronger nation dominates the weaker

Its economy and the politics in seek of

Power in the system: that’s imperialism

First they gonna take all the raw materials with them

And manufacture, right? That’s only half the side

And in addition, theyíre also flexing national pride

Now wait ëtil I tell you about the White Man’s Burden

It might be disturbing and you might feel uncertain

The European belief they’re supreme to the averages

And have the duty to civilize the savages

Money can motivate, religion may guide the conscience

African borders drawn up at-the-at-the Berlin Conference

Scramble for Africa, the colonizers want it

All the natural resources, meanwhile Japan was on its

Own, their feudal era’s isolationist

Til Commodore Matthew Perry started to trade with it

And then in Japan, emperors rose again

Meiji Restoration, the Tokugawa era ends

China tried the same, to close the open door

Til China and Britain fought up in the Opium Wars

In the name of the mother country and its spheres of influence

Don’t think the people took it without fighting and yelling

Sepoy Mutiny, the Zulus, and the Boxer Rebellion

India, Africa, and China would fight for their freedom

Mo’ Money Mo’ Power is the theme of the season

Oh yes, I know the reason

Oh yes, I know the reason

Hell yes, oh yes

I know what you want

I know what you want

Battles fought in the trenches

Technology advanced steadily

Better weapons made it deadly

In the meantime, what else is brewing? 

Russian Revolution, forming the Soviet Union 

Totalitarian rulers ruling the peasants 

The Communist leader called Vladimir Lenin 

Then again in Germany and Italy you saw the rise of fascists

Who swore to people they would bring them out of The Depression

Weak League of Nations and power of oratory

Germany had Adolf Hitler, he had the Nazi Party

Italy had Mussolini, and yeah, they both had armies

Japan’s objective was expanding far out from the Far East

These three would form the Axis, aggressive

Expansionism invading neighbors, borders were pressured

England used the method, appeasement: peaceful compromise

But World War II would begin in 1939

Oh me, oh my

Part II

Verse 4

Germany strikes to get the conflict rolling

When Hitler decides he would invade Poland

This move would divide Europe in the moment

Japan battles China in the Pacific Ocean

This war would be fought on two fronts

With tanks and guns in Europe and Asia with boats and planes in ë41

Japan bombed Pearl Harbor, got the U.S. fired up

U.S. joined the Soviets and the English to form the Allies

Deadliest war ever survived 

70 million died on every side

Ending with the bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki

The U.S. dropped the nuke

Couple hundred-thousand bodies

Verse 5

The Allies would win in order to prevent

Another war from forming, they would form the UN [United Nations]

Self-determination, decolonization

Well, at least they would try to defend the colonized

Much of Europe destroyed, Japan was petrified

Germany would be blamed with bloody genocide

Millions of Jews, Gypies, Blacks and Queers murdered

In the Holocaust where they feared the Führer

The war changed the way the world was living

Democracy vs. Communism was the new division

Stalin and the Communists formed the Warsaw Pact

Against NATO and democracies to counteract

The U.S. and the Soviets arose as superpowers

Setting up 50 years of Cold War to see who’s a coward

Who’s a coward?","Chorus

Some people’d rather have equal wages 

Than seeing anyone without a home 

Business becomes state-regulated

No class difference, but many are poor

Verse 1

During World War I the Triple Entente

Were desperate and depressed from the guns and the bombs

Russia in particular got hit really hard

Two million soldiers dead and the war wasn’t done

Still out in the field, out of ammunition

Very little hope, plus the weather so frigid

Back in St. Petersburg the Czar was protested

Army didn’t have his back; he’s hardly protected

Another leader’s word and influence was spreading

People were dissenting led by Vladimir Lenin

The army had split, ready for the mutiny

People were starved and broke, treated inhumanly

Lenin preached communism and was fully equipped

To lead the Russian Revolution and the Bolsheviks

Which he called the Red Army, brought the czar to an end

Chanting all the while we need, ‘Peace, land, and bread!’

Chorus

Some people’d rather have equal wages 

Than seeing anyone without a home 

Verse 2

Communism is based on the writings of Karl Marx

The Communist Manifesto, specifically, left its mark

Empowered the working class, that is the proletariat

Equal wages and land instead of ownership pyramids

Communism opposed capitalism

A profit-driven system with the goal of getting rich and

A social alternative, may sound like an oddity

The state regulated businesses: command economy

This was Russia’s goal of Communist Revolution

Overthrew the czar, then rose the Soviet Union

Under Lenin came the first Bolshevik generation

After Lenin came Stalin and collectivization

This turned private farms into communal farmland

Stalin introduced what he called the Five-Year Plans

The plan would spark economic resurrection

China would model this to climb out of Depression

Chorus

Some people’d rather have equal wages 

Than seeing anyone without a home 

Verse 3

In the early 1900s China started to split

The division caused by economics and politics

Both vying for control, two parties in the mix

One side was Nationalists, the other the Communists

Chinese Revolution as it’s commonly known

A civil war that took 25 years and more

This struggle amongst people would ravage on for long

The Communists were led by a certain Mao Zedong

And Mao used violent tactics for half a century

Forming the People’s Republic a.k.a. The PRC

Five-Year Plans transforming the economy

Great Leap Forward was the second of the plans, you see

Mandated collective farming outlawed the private

Many died from starving or killed for not abiding

Mao faced opposition, there was talk of outing him

He was challenged by liberals, one named Deng Xiaoping

Deng had a vision for social salvation

Which you can find outlined in Four Modernizations

A plan for China developing the nation’s

Agriculture, industry, defense, science and education

Mao tried to counter this modernist movement

With his Little Red Book and Cultural Revolution

China had split into mainland and island

And to this day it remains divided

Chorus

Some people’d rather have equal wages 

Than seeing anyone without a home 

And business becomes state-regulated

No class difference, but many are poor","Intro

Yeah, that’s how I’m feeling tonight

All these confrontations, a clash of ideologies, really

They were a product of alliances and worldwide policies

And it was cold, man

1960s to 1970s, it was cold

Verse 1

Yo, have you heard the news about a couple of crews?

Superpowers not cowards had a bundle of nukes

Red, white, and blue, that’s U.S.A.

Where they stack their money the American way

That’s capitalism, free market system

Now the Soviet Union was totally different

They had a command economy: communism

What is it?

Where the government regulates production and business

World War II is over, America lends a hand

To help rebuild Europe with the Marshall Plan

Offered to the Soviets, they refused to listen

They had their own vision: spreading communism

Nations nearby they would occupy

Under their control and turn them into satellites

The world war’s over, where is the peace sign?

The Berlin Wall solidified the East and West divide

Chorus

Bitter Cold, Bitter-Bitter-Bitter Cold War

Bitter Cold, Bitter-Bitter-Bitter Cold War

Bitter Cold, Bitter-Bitter-Bitter Cold 

Then the Iron Curtain falls and they toppled the Wall

Verse 2

Now we got two sides that make each other vexed

Communist in the East, democratic in the West

Both spent money on making nuclear threats

To intimidate the other with weapons that they would flex

Paranoia that most Americans shared

Fear of communism spreading: the Red Scare

One country falls, then another pair

The Domino Theory says it will spread everywhere

U.S. made the Truman Doctrine for containment, yo

They got with Western Europe teaming up as NATO

Eastern Europe teaming up as Warsaw Pact though

Cuba the communist ally led by Castro

Cuban Missile Crisis, near Florida’s shore

Though nothing was fired, speeches were hardcore

First East and West battle: the Korean War

The bloodiest of all was in the Vietnam [War] 

Chorus

Bitter Cold, Bitter-Bitter-Bitter Cold War

Bitter Cold, Bitter-Bitter-Bitter Cold War

Bitter Cold, Bitter-Bitter-Bitter Cold 

Then the Iron Curtain falls and they toppled the Wall

Bitter Cold, Bitter-Bitter-Bitter Cold War

Bitter Cold, Bitter-Bitter-Bitter Cold War

Bitter Cold, Bitter-Bitter-Bitter Cold 

Then the Iron Curtain falls and they toppled the Wall

Verse 3

After 30 years could the Cold War be warm?

In the ‘70s we saw reform

Tension decreased between the West and East

Detente brought the Cold War out of a deep freeze

By the ‘80s the presidents stopped hating

Mikhail Gorbachev was meeting with Ronald Reagan

Reopened trading, the policy of Glasnost:

Free enterprise in the Eastern Bloc

Employers, more employers

Reviving the economy: Perestroika

See, presidents and citizens changed their minds

When they tore down the Berlin Wall in ë89

The symbolic end of the Cold War

Communism in Europe was practically no more

The U.S.S.R. was now broken up

But the free market economy was so corrupt

Now Russia and U.S. were pals

Who could’ve dreamed of seeing McDonald’s in Moscow?

This is today, who knows the future?

There’s still communism in China and Cuba

Chorus

Bitter Cold, Bitter-Bitter-Bitter Cold War

Bitter Cold, Bitter-Bitter-Bitter Cold War

Bitter Cold, Bitter-Bitter-Bitter Cold 

Then the Iron Curtain falls and they toppled the Wall

Bitter Cold, Bitter-Bitter-Bitter Cold War

Bitter Cold, Bitter-Bitter-Bitter Cold War

Bitter Cold, Bitter-Bitter-Bitter Cold 

Then the Iron Curtain falls and they toppled the Wall

Verse 4

The Cold War was as tense as the pressure on pearls

But what was going on with the rest of the world?

The East and West divided, the Iron Curtain raising

European colonies gained self-determination

Keeping colonies over distance is a long road

Europeans couldn’t maintain their stronghold

Colonies sensed it, went in for the win

Indochina (that’s Vietnam) followed Ho Chi Minh

India fought the British oh, so calmly

Civil disobedience: the way of Gandhi

Peaceful protests boycotts were the start

Rallying against taxes with the Salt March

Egypt, Ghana, and Kenya fought the British

Egypt controlled the Suez Canal through the isthmus

The independence fighters for Kenya and Ghana

Were Kwame Nkrumah and Jomo Kenyatta

South Africans and Mandela fought Apartheid

British drew battle lines through Israel and Palestine

With the creation of the Balfour Declaration

Creating Israel a sovereign Jewish nation

Iranians revolt to have their own Islamic state

At the time, independence movements were commonplace", "Verse 1

I depend on my brother, the world is such a village

We depend on each other, that is interdependence

And if a region changes, it affects all of the planet

When the U.S. stock crashes the whole world’s in a panic

Pollution in Los Angeles, breathe in those sweet fumes

Oil from Iraq, they died for us to speed -  vrrooom!

Alliances serve markets of people

NAFTA, OPEC, oh yes, and even the EU

They created the Euro currency

War for money’s why your cousin’s serving overseas

For bigger change we need a hero with urgency

For bigger change our families migrate to urban scenes

Urbanization time, farmers moving from the country 

That population rise, move to cities for the money

More cars, more fuel, burning higher emissions

More slums, more work, less time for traditions

Ain’t it really something?

Chorus A

And now that we are at the end

It means that you must begin at the beginning of this book

You begin there and you run through everything 

Until you hear this message again

Verse 2

Globalization grew, and so did the drama

Ethnic conflicts in the Balkans and also Rwanda

Human rights violations are making you somber

India, Pakistan neighbors on the map began

Fighting holy wars ever since way back when

Over religious differences aim nuclear caps at friends

Oldest conflict’s between Israel and Palestine

There ain’t no peace across the Middle Eastern battle lines

Hey, what’s right or wrong? 

Hey, what’s good or evil?

What do you do when governments oppress your own people?

Students in China protesting

Man, it should’ve been fair

Government guns massacred them at Tiananmen Square

Pinochet in Chile, Saddam Hussein in Iraq

Milosevic in Yugoslavia on the attack

All of the above are some examples of cruel leaders

Genocide, ethnic cleansing, physical features

Chorus B

Yeah, be bright like you are; you’ll be good

Don’t gotta worry about it; you put in the work

Start at the beginning; we are now at the end

Remember: history is a circle

Verse 3

After 9/11, War on Terror sounded your alarm

Ringing on and on, and Saddam, he was half the plan

Iraq got invaded, but first it was Afghanistan

Looking for Al-Qaeda, conflict with the Taliban

Humanitarian aid to relieve social problems of the ‘Third World’ pain

AIDS, famine, and hunger, and low literacy rates

They call this the developing world, but whoís to say who developed 

anyway?  

Establishing schools, remove tyrannical rule

While at home we’re reducing the use of fossil fuels

Can ride a bike, wind power, or recycle your paper

There’s a hole as big as Greenland up in the ozone layer

Trees slashed and burned with deforestation

Global warming dries the land, desertification

Food shortages from the overpopulation

Humans upon humans

To feed us all consuming 

We increase crop yield during the Green Revolution

Fertilizers and pesticides help us grow more food but

Side effects of genetically altered crops include pollution

And some of these processed foods got us morphing into mutants!

Chorus C

It’s disgusting, I tell you! 

It is disgusting. 

We are in uncertain times

But destiny lies in your hands and what you decide to do with it"
